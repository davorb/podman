* Introduction
Ok, so this repository contains a podcast player that was written as
an assignment. It needs server code to run, that is not supplied in
this repo.

Since the project is so small, I decided not to divide the files into
a tree structure with directories. I also hardcoded the URL to the
server, whereas if I had been a little bit more serious with this, I
would have put the URL into an environmental variable. I also went
ahead and skipped all error handling code for this project, not to
mention localization.

Other than that, the project is fairly straight forward and launches
with `yarn start`.
